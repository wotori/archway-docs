# Participate in Governance

Archway governance is the process by which network participants and token holders can influence the future direction of the protocol through proposals and on-chain voting.

In addition to fees and staking, the $ARC token is used for governance. As a governance token, $ARC helps progressively decentralize the community while ensuring fair and transparent participation. All $ARC holders can propose changes to the protocol and vote on active proposals. Proposals that reach a consensus threshold are adopted, including proposals for a specific feature or even changing the governance system itself.

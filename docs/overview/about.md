# About Archway

Archway is a self-sovereign blockchain network that allows developers to express and get rewarded for their creativity.

## The Archway Mission

Archway makes it easy to develop decentralized applications and services. By empowering developers and sharing part of the network growth, incentivized innovation grows the network.

## Archway Mission Statement

The internet has helped to democratize access to information, but it hasn’t fully democratized access to capital markets. Entrepreneurs and developers around the world don’t have access to the same opportunities as their counterparts that live in more developed nations. 

Archway is on a mission to help change this inequity. 

Archway treats all developers and entrepreneurs around the world fairly, no matter their background or location. Built into the Archway protocol itself, Archway rewards developers based on the value and impact of their dApp, rather than their close association to capital.

Unlike existing Web 2.0 platforms or early versions of Web 3.0 layer 1s, where tokens are mostly concentrated in the hands of the first few early participants, the Archway community believes that all contributors should be able to participate in the community they help build.

The Archway protocol is designed to be shared with all contributors and all stakeholders, irrespective of their initial stakes or their current financial means. Appreciation and governance are shared with the entrepreneurs and developers who are building on the protocol. Archway is designed to build a world that is more accessible.

# Economic Overview

With Archway, dApps can earn a portion of transaction fees and inflationary rewards in exchange for their contributions to the network. This earning model is similar to how validators are rewarded for operating nodes in a typical Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chain. 
 
Archway seeks to provide three potential funding sources for dApps:

- Gas fee rebates 
- Share of inflationary rewards
- Smart contract fees (optional)

Archway allows each dApp developer and their communitiy to configure how the rewards are managed and distributed. When a contract is instantiated, the dApp creator specifies an `owner` address where all fees and rewards are automatically deposited. This target address can be their own, a multisig, or controlled by a separate custom contract. Ownership can then be transferred to a new address as needed, only requiring the signature of the previous owner.

# WASM 

> *WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine.
> Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.*

WebAssembly encodes a low-level, assembly-like programming language. To ensure developer interoperability, Archway uses a custom WebAssembly distribution. 

For the current spec, see [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/intro/overview.html).

# CosmWasm

CosmWasm is built as a Cosmos SDK module to allow sovereign chains to run smart contracts. It leverages WASM to provide safe, easy-to-use binaries that can cross programming language barriers.

For more information, see [CosmWasm](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/docs/0.16/architecture/multichain).

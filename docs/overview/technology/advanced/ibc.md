# Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)
The IBC protocol makes it possible for blockchains to connect to each other. Built on Cosmos, Archway natively integrates IBC so users can frictionlessly exchange assets and data with other Cosmos-enabled chains. dApps deploy straight to Archway and plug directly into IBC without additional development or the need to spin up an independent chain.

This native integration helps expand a developer’s addressable market by opening up access to users and liquidity from other chains, while also allowing their token to be ported and utilized elsewhere.

Archway’s native IBC integration enables developers to future-proof their dApps. Rather than betting on a single isolated chain or scaling solution and then being locked into that ecosystem, dApps built on the Archway protocol exist across an interconnected network of chains and can be migrated with ease if needed.

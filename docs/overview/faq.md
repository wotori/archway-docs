# FAQ

Answers to frequently asked questions about Archway.

## What is Archway?

Archway is an incentivized smart contract chain for the Cosmos ecosystem that allows developers to deploy high-performance dApps and get rewarded for the value they contribute to the network.

## Why Archway?

When developers build and launch impactful dApps that generate usage on Archway, they earn a proportional share of network fees and rewards. This shared earning model enables developers to potentially access recurring streams of funding and participate in the protocol’s success.

Along with a more inclusive rewards model, Archway’s technical design is optimized for a seamless developer experience. The protocol provides a full WebAssembly (Wasm) implementation for cross-language support, a Web3-compatible API, and native bridges that connect to other networks for cross-chain communication and asset transfers.

## Does Archway have a native staking token?

Yes, Archway has a native staking token that is used for governance of the protocol. The native staking token is $ARC. This native staking token helps maintain and support the Archway decentralized community while ensuring fair and transparent participation. All holders of the native token can propose changes to the Archway protocol and vote on active proposals. Proposals that reach a consensus threshold are adopted, whether a specific feature or even changing the governance system itself.

## Will there be an Archway airdrop? Will there be a Cosmos community airdrop?

Early contributors and adopters of the protocol want to be rewarded. An airdrop is not confirmed at this time. All applicable laws across multiple jurisdictions are being investigated. Be sure to subscribe to the Archway email newsletter for further information. 

## When will Archway launch?

The planned launch for the Archway is sometime in mid-2022.
